              Hello! My name is Patrick Yolian and I am a Front-End Web Developer.  I started seriously developing websites in November of 2015 and have been striving to become better as a professional with every passing day and every line of code.
            </p>
            <p class="copy">
              I am fluent in HTML + CSS + JavaScript.  I have experience with jQuery and RWD. I am passionate about learning everyday and am excited by the ever developing (pun intended) technologies and design styles that our vibrant community produces everyday.
